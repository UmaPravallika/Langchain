NLP Preprocessing for RAG\\nPreprocessing is essential to convert raw text into clean, structured data for embeddings and \\nretrieval.\\n## Common Preprocessing Steps\\n1. **Tokenization**\\n   - Split text into words or subwords.\\n   - Libraries: NLTK, SpaCy, Hugging Face tokenizers.\\n2. **Stopword Removal**\\n   - Removes common words with little semantic value.\\n   - Example: \"the\", \"is\", \"and\".\\n3. **Stemming & Lemmatization**\\n   - Stemming: Reduces words to base form (e.g., \"running\" → \"run\").\\n   - Lemmatization: Converts to dictionary form using context.\\n4. **Lowercasing & Cleaning**\\n   - Remove punctuation, special characters, and normalize whitespace.\\n## Advanced Preprocessing\\n- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**\\n  - Tags proper nouns, organizations, locations, etc.\\n- **POS Tagging**\\n  - Identifies parts of speech to improve semantic understanding.\\n- **Handling Tables and Code**\\n  - Extract as separate chunks with metadata.Comprehensive Guide to LLMs, RAG, and LangChain\\n1. Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)\\n- Definition: LLMs are deep learning models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and\\ngenerate human-like text.\\n- Applications: chatbots, content generation, translation, summarization, etc.\\n- Popular Models: GPT-3, GPT-4, BERT, T5, etc.\\n2. Understanding Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\\n- Concept: Combines LLMs with external knowledge sources for more accurate responses.\\n- Components:\\n    - Retrieval: Searching external databases or documents.\\n    - Augmentation: Integrating retrieved info into the generation process.\\n- Benefits: Reduces hallucinations, provides up-to-date information.\\n3. Introduction to LangChain\\n- Definition: Framework to simplify development of applications powered by LLMs.\\n- Features: Document Loaders, Text Splitters, Vector Stores, Chains.\\n- Use Cases: Chatbots, Q&A systems, summarizers.\\n4. Building a RAG Application with LangChain\\n- Step 1: Data Ingestion\\n- Step 2: Text Splitting\\n- Step 3: Embedding and Indexing\\n- Step 4: Retrieval\\n- Step 5: Generation\\n5.

Best Practices and Considerations\\n- Model Selection: Align with application requirements.\\n- Data Privacy: Handle sensitive data securely.\\n- Performance Optimization: Use caching and efficient retrieval.\\n- Continuous Improvement: Update knowledge base and fine-tune models.\\n7.
